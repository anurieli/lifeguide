When you read it every day, think if your responses still resonate; if not, change them. \n\n The more you become one with it the better you can get it to be exactly what you need to succeed (you can cut out fluff, hone in on what really matters as you slowly remove things that don't feed your purpose)."

Before submitting these sections, review them and question them before moving onto the next section.  \n- ðŸ”´ *This should be a constant,* as it's much harder to run towards a moving goal.
